## Getting Started

Notification center consists of below two components which are used for sending and managing the notification & alerts.
* notification-api
* notification-sp

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
- Java 17
- Maven
- Container environment

### Installation

- [Install Java 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)

- [How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

- Install Docker on your machine by referring to official Docker documnentation to have a Container environment.

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the validate phase and check goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run checkstyle plugin explicitly, run the following command:

```mvn checkstyle:check```

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

The component can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod by installing Notification Center charts.
